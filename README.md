I’ve spent over a decade in the design field, freelancing as a graphic designer in Wellington, New Zealand, and Vancouver, Canada, and bringing a global perspective to my work. Recently, I completed an intensive web development bootcamp at Neue Fische, where I learned to code from scratch and discovered new ways to merge my creative and technical expertise.

With a seasoned design background, I bring a sharp eye for detail and a passion for aesthetics to my work. With this blend of technical skills and creative vision, I’m excited to build user-friendly, visually engaging digital experiences as I step into the world of web development.

Whether I’m coding responsive web applications or designing intuitive interfaces, I’m dedicated to creating products that balance functionality with style. I believe in the importance of clean code, beautiful design, and, above all, a seamless user experience.

Looking for someone who’s both creative and tech-savvy? Let’s connect and bring great ideas to life!
